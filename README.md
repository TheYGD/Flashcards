# Flashcards

Simple flashcards project made with Spring Boot. It lest users to create their own flashcards sets.Those sets are available for other users. They can learn from them. 
After the set completion, the set is being 'reloaded', which basically means that user should wait for the given time for set to be reloaded, but they can of course reload set manually earlier if they want to. This reload time increases after each set's completion, so it helps users to learn more effectively.
Sets used by user are having colorful badges in their right upper corner, so that the user can easily see if the set is already reloaded and distinguish their active sets from others.
